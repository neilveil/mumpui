        Unlike other front-end libraries, <b>MumpUI</b> does not comes with colorful buttons, firstly because they are
        old school & secondly the colors should always be selected based on the application theme.

        Earlier about 10 years ago, colorful buttons were used to take actions but now the actions are taken through
        click/hover on icon, cards, text etc. Except for primary button, and that too is used mostly just for form
        submission.
